Cacti are no longer stronger than lava! Cactusfix makes items not get destroyed by cacti. It still does damage mobs / players, which is intentional. Cactusfix is made for the FabricMC Minecraft modding platform.

The mod works out of the box, just drag and drop it into your mods' folder. This is needed on the serverside too!
There is a gamerule which can toggle Cactusfix on and off. It is called `shouldCactusDamageItems`, and is off by default. If you wish to enable cactus despawning items, you can run `/gamerule shouldCactusDamageItems true`.

## FAQ

**Can I use this mod in my modpack?**

Yes! You are more than welcome to include my mod in your modpack, if you credit me properly, and make downloads go thru my modrinth page.

**Does this damage players?**

Originally I made it so players don't take damage, but I decided to remove this for the 1.0.0 release.

**Plz updat to forge**

I won't update to forge, as I have never touched it, and have no plan to do so.

**Will you update this to new MC versions?**

If I feel like it :)
